            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                When I started building this website, my goal was pretty simple: I wanted it to look good, but also send a strong message. It needed to be slick, modern, and capture the urgency of climate change, all while showcasing the beauty of the Everglades.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="design-process">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>
                I first started in Microsoft Paint. I made a rough sketch of how I wanted my webpage to look like. I made sure to add some basic labels so I knew what pictures I was going to use, what titles were going to be for what sections and so on. 
            </p>
            <p>So, I organized the site with different sections, like one about climate problems in the Everglades and another about possible solutions. You'll notice that some images are clickable and will take you to more information about the possible solutions to the climate issues. I wanted the user to explore a bit to find more information and sources.</p>
            <p>
                I also like using pictures to tell a story. Take that laptop image in the Solutions section with the line "You should be working." It's like a friendly nudge, reminding us we've got a job to do saving the Everglades and our planet.

                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="Wireframe/Wireframe_Climate_Justice.png" target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; max-width: 20%;">
                        <img src="Wireframe/Wireframe_Climate_Justice.png" alt="Image containing the wireframe of my main webpage made in Microsoft Paint" >
                    </a>
                </div>
            <p>However, I found that my page did not look good on mobile with my original design in my Wireframe so I did some final changes in the end.</p>
            <p>I kept the same elements of my sketch/wireframe but I reorganized them to better fit both mobile devices while still keeping a good design for desktop browsers.</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                The tools I used for this webpage were HTML, CSS and Microsoft Paint and Visual Studio Code. 
            </p>

        <section id="testing">
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Since I already had my site hosted wtih Github, I used my different mobile devices and installed Firefox and a few other web browsers to test my webpage. I made sure everything worked how I intended on each browser and device. I even tried it on my vr headset just to see how it would look like.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In a nutshell, this project has been very interesting and eye opening to make. I feel like I learned a lot about climate change and how it's affecting people and our wildlife. I also feel like I have started to appreciate the power of HTML and CSS more.
