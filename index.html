        <h2>The Everglades</h2>
        <p>The Florida Everglades, known as the "River of Grass," are a unique and invaluable natural wonder, standing as a bastion of biodiversity. This wetland ecosystem is home to endangered species like the Florida panther and provides shelter for diverse bird and aquatic life. Beyond its ecological significance, the Everglades affects water quality, climate regulation, and serves as a cultural and recreational treasure. To preserve its intricate balance, unique history, and ecological importance, it's essential that we continue to invest in its protection and restoration.</p>

                <h2>Aquifier Storage and Recovery (ASR)</h2>
                <p>ASR involves injecting excess surface water into underground aquifers for storage and later use during dry periods. This technology can help reduce freshwater loss to the ocean and provide a reliable source of water for wetland restoration projects. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/climate-change-alters-whats-possible-in-restoring-floridas-everglades" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p>

                <h2>Constructed Wetlands</h2>
                <p>Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that mimic natural wetlands to treat wastewater or stormwater runoff. They can be used to remove excess nutrients from agricultural runoff before it enters the Everglades. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/climate-change-alters-whats-possible-in-restoring-floridas-everglades" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p>

                <h2>Water Quality Treatment Areas (WQTAs)</h2>
                <p>WQTAs are constructed wetlands that are designed to remove excess nutrients from agricultural runoff before it enters the Everglades. They are an essential component of CERP 3. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/explore/savingearth/climate-change-alters-whats-possible-in-restoring-floridas-everglades" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p>
