            <h2>The Everglades</h2>
            <p>The Florida Everglades, known as the "River of Grass," are a unique and invaluable natural wonder, standing as a bastion of biodiversity. This wetland ecosystem is home to endangered species like the Florida panther and provides shelter for diverse bird and aquatic life. Beyond its ecological significance, the Everglades affects water quality, climate regulation, and serves as a cultural and recreational treasure. To preserve its intricate balance, unique history, and ecological importance, it's essential that we continue to invest in its protection and restoration.</p>

                    <h2>Drought Danger</h2>
                    <p>According to a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-throws-a-wrench-in-everglades-restoration/" target="_blank">Scientific American</a> article, climate change is causing drought and heat that are driving massive seagrass die-offs in the Everglades.</p>

                    <h2>Rising Sea Levels</h2>
                    <p>Another significant impact of climate change on the Everglades is the rise in sea levels, which is causing saltwater instrusion into freshwater ecosystems.</p>

                    <h2>Endangered Wildlife</h2>
                    <p>According to the <a href="https://home.nps.gov/ever/learn/nature/climatechange.htm" target="_blank">National Park Service</a>, saltwater intrusion is also causing the decline in the population of wading birds, such as the roseate spoonbill and wood stork.</p>

                    <h2>Aquifier Storage and Recovery (ASR)</h2>
                    <p>ASR involves injecting excess surface water into underground aquifers for storage and later use during dry periods. This technology can help reduce freshwater loss to the ocean and provide a reliable source of water for wetland restoration projects.</p>

                    <h2>Constructed Wetlands</h2>
                    <p>Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that mimic natural wetlands to treat wastewater or stormwater runoff. They can be used to remove excess nutrients from agricultural runoff before it enters the Everglades.</p>

                    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                    <p>One of the ways AI can help with restoration efforts is by analyzing large datasets from various sources such as remote sensing data, weather data, or water quality data. This can help identify patterns or trends that could be used to improve restoration efforts.</p>
